Next Steps at Vanderbilt - Safety Guidelines for Internships
More information on Vanderbilt’s Health and Safety Protocols can be found here: https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/community/undergraduate-students/
Masks: All Next Steps interns and job coaches must wear masks indoors at internships even if the jobsite does not require masks.
Interns and job coaches should have a well-fitted mask that completely covers your nose and mouth, preferably a KN95, KF94 or FFP2 version.
Lunch Breaks: If an intern or job coach needs a lunch break, they can remove their mask just when they eat or drink. They must be physically distanced from other co-workers when eating. 
Symptom Monitoring: All interns and job coaches must be free of ANY symptoms related to COVID-19 to go to the internship. If an intern or job coach has symptoms, they should stay home, notify the Next Steps staff and internship supervisor, and get tested at Vanderbilt Student Health or with their medical provider.
According to the CDC, symptoms may appear 2 to 14 days after exposure to the virus. These include:
* Fever or chills
* Cough
* Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
* Fatigue
* Muscle or body aches
* Headache
* New loss of taste or smell
* Sore throat
* Congestion or runny nose
* Nausea or vomiting
* Diarrhea


If an intern or job coach tests positive: If an intern or job coach receives a COVID-19 positive test result, regardless of vaccination status, they should complete the following webform. The webform goes directly to the Vanderbilt Command Center.
The intern or job coach will receive direct communication from the Command Center about their isolation (if they tested positive) or quarantine period (if considered a close contact) and will be instructed to contact Student Health or Occupational Health if they develop symptoms.
Close Contact/Quarantine: Interns or job coaches who are a close contact of someone who tests positive should complete the following webform. The webform goes directly to the Command Center.
* Close contacts who are unvaccinated will quarantine for 10 days based on CDC guidance.
o Additional requirements are in place for days 10 to 14 following exposure including:
* For days 10 to 14 after last exposure, unvaccinated Vanderbilt community members identified as close contacts must not unmask at any time in public.
* Individuals should eat alone or complete any activities alone that require removing a mask in a private space during those four days between day 10-14.
* Close contacts who are vaccinated and asymptomatic will not have to quarantine but are recommended to monitor their symptoms and to get a COVID-19 test 5-7 days after last exposure. If asymptomatic, testing can be done at the VU testing center. If individuals develop symptoms, they should test at Student Health, Occupational Health or VUMC or other testing location in the community.
* Close contacts who are vaccinated and symptomatic may have to quarantine based on severity of symptoms and specific living situations. This determination will be made by their medical provider in consultation with the Command Center.
Job Coaching Supports: If a job coach tests positive and is unable to provide on-site supports, Next Steps staff will follow the procedures outlined below.
1. Identify another job coach or Next Steps staff member who can provide job coaching on-site during some of the student’s internship hours.
2. Identify another job coach or staff member who can check-in virtually with the student and supervisor during their shift. 
3. Or, work with the student and supervisor to ensure natural supports are in place if the student must work without support of a job coach during that time period.
