# Job Coach Question Answering

Job Coach Question Answering is an open-source AI tool designed to assist new hires in quickly accessing essential details about their jobs, including location, contact information, and available resources. Users can inquire about any job-related queries, and the model promptly generates accurate responses. By leveraging this solution, significant time can be saved at job sites for both new hires and supervisors, as redundant questions can be efficiently addressed by the model.

## Background
Getting a new job is exciting! However, navigating new job sites can be overwhelming, as new hires must familiarize themselves with various responsibilities, locations, supervisors, resources, and contact information, among other things. To assist in a smooth transition for new hires, the initial version of Job Coach Question Answering was developed during DSSG 2022. This AI-powered model enables new hires to obtain immediate answers to almost any question without the need to contact a supervisor or endure delays in response.

This year, our primary objective is to enhance the model even further. Previously, users were required to upload documents, and the model itself was hosted on AWS, requiring heavy infrastructure. Our aim is to make the model easily accessible to both developers and users by providing predefined prompts. Additionally, we acknowledge that the previous model occasionally generated hallucinated answers, plausible yet incorrect answers, and we are committed to addressing this issue with greater care. Our goal is to improve the model based on the challenges we have identified.
