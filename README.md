# Job Coach Question Answering

Job Coach Question Answering is an open-source AI tool designed to assist new hires in quickly accessing essential details about their jobs, including location, contact information, and available resources. Users can inquire about any job-related queries, and the model promptly generates accurate responses. By leveraging this solution, significant time can be saved at job sites for both new hires and supervisors, as redundant questions can be efficiently addressed by the model.

## Background
Getting a new job is exciting! However, navigating new job sites can be overwhelming, as new hires must familiarize themselves with various responsibilities, locations, supervisors, resources, and contact information, among other things. To assist in a smooth transition for new hires, the initial version of Job Coach Question Answering was developed during DSSG 2022. This AI-powered model enables new hires to obtain immediate answers to almost any question without the need to contact a supervisor or endure delays in response.

This year, our primary objective is to enhance the model even further. Previously, users were required to upload documents, and the model itself was hosted on AWS, requiring heavy infrastructure. Our aim is to make the model easily accessible to both developers and users by providing predefined prompts. Additionally, we acknowledge that the previous model occasionally generated hallucinated answers, plausible yet incorrect answers, and we are committed to addressing this issue with greater care. Our goal is to improve the model based on the challenges we have identified.

## Getting Started

This section provides a step-by-step guide to setting up and using Job Coach QA. We aim to make the setup process as straightforward as possible to make this tool accessible.

### Requirements
To use Job Coach QA, you'll need:

Internet connection
A web browser

To use Job Coach QA, you will need:
- Internet connection
- A web browser

### Instructions

1. Visit OpenAI ChatGPT Interface
Start by opening your web browser and navigating to the OpenAI interface at https://chat.openai.com/

2. Input Your Prompt
Once you're on the OpenAI interface, you'll see a text box where you can input your prompt. The prompt can be asking questions, situation, or task from the employee handbook that you would like to get information about. Examples of prompts can be "What is the dress code policy?" or "What are the office working hours?"

3. Submit Your Prompt
After entering your prompt, press 'Enter' or click on the 'Submit' button to submit your query.

4. Get Your Response
Once you've submitted your prompt, the model will analyze it and generate a response. This may take a few moments. The response will appear in a conversation-like format below your inputted prompt.

Review Your Response
Review the response generated by the model. If it doesn't answer your query satisfactorily, consider rephrasing your prompt or simply try again. Please remember that AI's responses are based on the input it receives, so clear and direct prompts often yield the most accurate and helpful results.
